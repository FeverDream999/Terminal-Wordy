# TERMINAL WORDY - OFFLINE COMMAND LINE WORDLE INSPIRED GAME

## A small program that allows you to play Wordy against yourself, a bot and even make said bot guess your word via the terminal.

TERMINAL WORDY full set of features (that be unique or inspired by the original game) are:

- Play against yourself, guessing a word from a bratty Bunny
- Make Wordy (the ASCII cat) guess any word from the default and custom word list
- Compete against Wordy in a guessing competition with Bunny being a impartial judge (Not yet implemented)
- Add custom words
- Reset custom words
- Reset matches

## User instructions

Fill this (lol) but essentially you can just clone the repository to vsc and touch the little play button in the top right (after installing a small library)

## How it works

also fill this later

## Developer instructions

im using a template to make a good readme, this probabbly will never be needed but im keeping it in the readme to tell the world which features i will implement in the future

- a feature that automatically plays the game and modifies a file with its results, this is to later have data and measure the efficiency of the bot (that plays in hardmode)
- maybe port it as an app for people that dont understand the terminal and want an offline wordle experience
- ofc the compete against wordy, thats kinda the main idea of the program but havent yet made it
- maybe another bot that is not restrained by the letters it found and can try any word regardless. (this to actually be more precise in later attempts)
- a frequency bias? as in, i downloaded the most frequent words of the english dictionary in order and it may help the bot in some situations

## Known issues

- When bunny punishes you in the last instance of the game it does not show you which word she had
